Gully Boy for his new rap, creating a list of characters, so that list can be arranged in different manners, as per the mood of crowd. 
#They seek help from GLA students because they feel this is "Boht Hard" to create. 
#Your task is to keep a linked list of characters for creating rap, but do not keep "white space" character in linked list

#Whenever anyone from the crowd gave gully boy a position of node they have to sing all the linked character N times to create a rap.

#for example charsequence is "hello world", int position is 6, N is 1.
#we have to store each character in node except white-space, so node position 6 will have 'w' stored in it. 
#And we have to print all characters once so the output will be:
     #w o r l d h e l l o





char_sequence = input()
position = int(input())
N = int(input())

char_sequence = char_sequence.replace(" ", "")

total_length = len(char_sequence)

start_index = (position - 1) % total_length

rap = (char_sequence[start_index:] + char_sequence[:start_index]) * N

print(" ".join(rap))
