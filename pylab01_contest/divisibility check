#Given an integer number and two divisors d1 and d2, we have to check whether number is divisible by d1 and d2 or not.
#Print "Yes." if number is divisible by both the entered divisors.
#Print "No." if number is not divisible by both or any of the entered divisors.






A=int(input())
d1=int(input())
d2=int(input())
r1=A % d1 == 0
r2=A % d2 == 0
B = r1 and r2
b=A%d1==A%d2
c="Yes."*B+"No."*(1-B)
print(c)
