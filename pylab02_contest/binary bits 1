#compare bits in two numbers and return true or false, 0 or 1, for each bit compared.

#Bitwise AND operator & The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1.

#If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0. It is denoted by &.

#Bitwise OR operator | The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1. It is denoted by |.

#Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator ^ The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. 


#Now task is, you will be given 2 integers and a thershold k. find the maximum value between bitwise and, or and xor. 
#the maximum should not greater than the thershold k.

#default maximum value is zero.
